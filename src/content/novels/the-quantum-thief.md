# The Quantum Thief

Marcus discovered his ability at age twelve: he could reach into the fabric of time and pull out moments, storing them like coins in a pocket. By twenty-five, he was the most sought-after thief in the world.

His latest job seems simple: steal twenty-four hours from a billionaire's timeline. But time, Marcus learns, doesn't like being stolen. And it always finds a way to balance the books.
