# Starbound Academy

The year is 2247. Humanity has colonized the solar system and stands on the brink of interstellar travel. At Starbound Academy, orbiting Jupiter's moon Europa, the next generation of officers trains for a future among the stars.

Cadet Maya Chen never expected to be chosen for the Academy's elite First Contact program. But when an alien signal is detected from Alpha Centauri, she and her squad are thrust into a mission that will determine humanity's place in the galaxy.
