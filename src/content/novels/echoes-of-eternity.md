# Echoes of Eternity

## The Eternal Cycle

The prophecy is ancient: when the stars align and darkness threatens to consume the world, five heroes will rise. They have risen before. They will rise again.

Every thousand years, the cycle repeats. Five souls, bound by destiny, are reborn into a world on the brink of destruction. They must find each other, remember their purpose, and face the Darkness that seeks to consume all existence.

## The Five Heroes

**The Warrior** - Born with the strength to move mountains and the courage to face any foe. In each life, they lead the charge against the Darkness.

**The Mage** - Wielder of ancient magic, keeper of forgotten knowledge. They remember fragments of past lives more clearly than the others.

**The Healer** - Blessed with the power to mend wounds and restore hope. They are the heart that binds the five together.

**The Shadow** - Master of stealth and secrets, they walk between light and dark. Their loyalty is absolute, but their methods are questionable.

**The Seer** - Gifted with visions of past and future, they guide the heroes toward their destiny. But seeing the future comes at a terrible price.

## The Volumes
