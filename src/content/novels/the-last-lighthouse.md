# The Last Lighthouse

Thomas has kept the lighthouse for fifteen years, watching the waves crash against the rocks below. His only companions are the seabirds and the endless rhythm of the ocean.

Then one morning, he finds a bottle washed ashore. Inside is a message dated ten years in the future, written in his own handwriting.
