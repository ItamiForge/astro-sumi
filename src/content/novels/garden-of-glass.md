# Garden of Glass

The Glass City is beautiful and terrible. Every building, every street, every bridge is made of crystal-clear glass. Light refracts through the city in rainbows, but one wrong step can shatter everything.

Mira is the city's only gardener. In her greenhouse of spun glass, she grows flowers that shouldn't exist: roses that bloom in midnight blue, lilies that glow with their own light, orchids that sing when the wind passes through them.

Each flower is a small rebellion against the fragility of glass, a promise that beauty can exist even in the most delicate of worlds.
