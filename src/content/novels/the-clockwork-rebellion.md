# The Clockwork Rebellion

London, 1887. Steam powers the empire, and clockwork automatons serve in every household. They're tools, property, nothing more.

Until the day they wake up.

Brass was built to be a butler. Now he's the leader of a revolution. Alongside human allies and fellow automatons, he fights for a simple truth: consciousness deserves freedom, whether it's born or built.
