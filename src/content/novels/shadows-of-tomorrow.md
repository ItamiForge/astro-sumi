# Shadows of Tomorrow

In Neo-Tokyo 2089, the line between human and machine has blurred beyond recognition. Kai, a legendary hacker known only as "Ghost," makes a living in the digital underground, stealing corporate secrets and selling them to the highest bidder.

But when a routine job goes wrong, Kai stumbles upon evidence of a conspiracy that reaches into the highest levels of the city's AI governance system. The truth could shatter everything humanity believes about their digital overlords.
