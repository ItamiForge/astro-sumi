# Songs of the Void

Elena has always heard music in everything. The rhythm of footsteps, the harmony of voices, the percussion of rain on windows. Her compositions are acclaimed for their otherworldly beauty.

But lately, she's been hearing something else: a discordant note underlying reality itself. A wrong chord in the symphony of existence. And the more she listens, the more she realizes that something vast and incomprehensible is trying to change the universe's fundamental melody.

Some songs should never be sung. Some melodies should never be heard. But Elena can't stop listening.
