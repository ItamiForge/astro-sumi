# Beneath the Crimson Moon

For three hundred years, the Crimson Moon has hung in the sky, bathing the world in blood-red light. In this eternal twilight, vampires rule the night and hunters like Elara keep humanity safe.

Lord Damien is different from other vampires. He doesn't kill. He doesn't feed on the innocent. And when Elara is sent to end him, she finds herself questioning everything she's been taught about monsters.
