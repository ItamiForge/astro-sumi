# The Memory Merchant

In a city where memories can be bought, sold, and stolen, Detective Sarah Chen has a gift: she can read the memories imprinted on objects. A touch of a wedding ring reveals a proposal. A bloodstained knife shows a murder.

But when she reads a knife and sees a woman being killed—only to find that woman alive and well—Sarah realizes that someone is planting false memories. And they're using her gift to frame an innocent person.
