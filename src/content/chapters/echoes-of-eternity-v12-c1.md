# Chapter 1: Beyond Eternity

At the end of all things, there was a choice.

Kael stood at the nexus of reality, where all timelines converged, where past and future met in an eternal present. Beside him stood his four companions—not just from this life, but from all lives, all versions of themselves merged into one.

They had fought the Darkness across eternity. They had died and been reborn countless times. They had sacrificed everything, only to discover that some sacrifices weren't enough.

The cycle couldn't be broken from within. It could only be transcended.

"Are you ready?" Aria asked, her voice echoing across all of time.

"To become something new?" Kael looked at each of them. "To stop being heroes and start being... something else?"

"We've been heroes long enough," Mira said. "Maybe it's time to be something more."

"Or something less," Ryn added with a grin. "I wouldn't mind being ordinary for once."

"There's no such thing as ordinary," Lyssa said gently. "Not for us. Not anymore. But we can choose what we become next."

Kael nodded. They had made so many choices across so many lives. One more wouldn't hurt.

"Together?" he asked.

"Always," they answered as one.

And together, the five heroes stepped beyond eternity, into something new.

*The End... and the Beginning*
