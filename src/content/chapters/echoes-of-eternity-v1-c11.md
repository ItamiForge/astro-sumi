# Chapter 11: The Breaking

The moment their weapons struck the heart of the Darkness, reality screamed.

The cycle, which had held for countless millennia, shattered like glass. The Darkness convulsed, its form breaking apart, dissolving into nothing. But it didn't go quietly—it took pieces of the world with it, tearing holes in reality as it died.

Kael and Ryn were thrown back, expelled from the void. They crashed to the ground at the northern pass, where Mira, Lyssa, and Aria waited.

"Did it work?" Lyssa asked, rushing to heal them.

"Look," Aria whispered, pointing to the sky.

The stars were changing. Not dimming, but brightening, as if a veil had been lifted. The oppressive weight that had hung over the world for so long was gone, replaced by a lightness, a freedom that none of them had ever felt before.

"The cycle is broken," Mira confirmed, her voice filled with wonder and sorrow. "The Darkness is truly dead. And soon, so will we be."

They could feel it already—their souls beginning to unravel, the bonds that had held them together across eternity starting to fray. They had won. They had saved the world. And now they would pay the price.

"How long do we have?" Kael asked.

"Hours," Aria said. "Maybe a day. The universe is... adjusting. Rewriting itself without the cycle. When it's done, we'll be gone."

"Then let's make the most of it," Ryn said.
