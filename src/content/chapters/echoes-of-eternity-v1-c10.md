# Chapter 10: The Heart of Darkness

At the center of the void, they found it—a knot of twisted reality, the point where the first heroes had bound themselves to the Darkness. It pulsed with dark energy, fed by the cycle itself, growing stronger with each iteration.

"This is it," Ryn said. "Cut this, and the cycle ends. The Darkness dies, and so do we."

Kael raised his sword. Through the bond, he could feel the others—Mira, Lyssa, and Aria, still fighting on the outside, holding the line, keeping the Darkness contained. They were exhausted, nearly broken, but they held.

For him. For Ryn. For the chance to end this.

"Together?" Ryn asked, his daggers ready.

"Together," Kael confirmed.

But before they could strike, the Darkness spoke. Not in words, but in understanding that flooded their minds.

It didn't want to fight. It had never wanted to fight. It was trapped, just as they were, bound by the same cycle, forced to play its role as destroyer just as they were forced to play their roles as saviors.

"It's suffering," Kael realized. "Just like us."

"Then we end its suffering too," Ryn said. "We free everyone."

They struck.
