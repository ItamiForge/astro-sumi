# Chapter 8: The Warrior's Resolve

Kael had led armies. He had made impossible decisions, sacrificed pawns to save kings, sent soldiers to their deaths for the greater good. Across a hundred lifetimes, he had learned that leadership meant making the hard choices.

But this was different. This wasn't sending others to die. This was walking into oblivion himself, knowing he would never return.

"Do it," he said to Aria. "Tell me when."

"Kael, no—" Lyssa started.

"We made our choice," Kael interrupted gently. "All of us, together. This is just... the execution of that choice."

He looked at each of them one last time. Mira, blazing with ancient power. Lyssa, exhausted but still standing. Aria, tears streaming down her face as she counted down the seconds.

And somewhere in the Darkness, Ryn, waiting for him.

"Ten seconds," Aria said.

Kael raised his bronze sword. It seemed inadequate for what he was about to do, but it would serve. It had always served.

He took a breath. Remembered every life, every battle, every moment that had led to this.

"Now!"

Kael charged into the Darkness.
