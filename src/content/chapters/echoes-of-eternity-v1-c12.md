# Chapter 12: Echoes

They returned to Thornhaven as heroes. The village celebrated, not understanding that their saviors were dying, that the victory had cost everything.

The five heroes didn't tell them. There was no need to dampen the joy, to turn celebration into mourning. Instead, they smiled and accepted the gratitude, knowing it would be their last.

As the sun set on what would be their final day, they gathered one last time at Mira's hut. The bond between them was fading, but it was still there, still strong enough to let them feel each other's presence.

"Do you regret it?" Lyssa asked quietly.

"No," Kael said immediately. "We saved the world. Truly saved it. No more cycles, no more suffering. That's worth any price."

"I'll miss you all," Aria said, tears streaming down her face. "In every life, finding you again was the best part. And now..."

"Now we get to rest," Mira finished gently. "After so many lifetimes of fighting, we've earned that."

"Will there be anything after?" Ryn wondered. "Or is this truly the end?"

"I don't know," Aria admitted. "My visions stop here. But I like to think... I like to think that somewhere, somehow, we'll find each other again. Not as heroes, not as warriors. Just as friends."

They sat together as the stars came out, brighter than they'd ever been. And as the night deepened, they began to fade—not all at once, but gradually, like a candle burning down.

Kael was the last to go. As the Warrior, he had always been the strongest, the one who held on longest. He looked at the village one final time, at the people sleeping peacefully, unaware that their protectors were vanishing.

"It was worth it," he whispered to the night. "Every moment, every life, every sacrifice. It was all worth it."

And then, like an echo fading into silence, he was gone.

**Epilogue**

A thousand years later, in a world that had forgotten the Age of Bronze, a child was born with eyes that seemed to see beyond the present. Another was born with hands that could heal with a touch. A third with strength beyond measure. A fourth who moved like shadow. A fifth who fought like a warrior born.

They would never remember their past lives. They would never know they had once been heroes. They would never face the Darkness, because the Darkness was gone forever.

But sometimes, in dreams, they would see four other faces. And they would feel a bond they couldn't explain, a connection that transcended time and space.

The cycle was broken. The heroes were gone.

But their echo remained.

And perhaps, in the end, that was enough.
