summary: "Kai takes on what should be a routine corporate espionage job, but discovers something that shouldn't exist."
draft: false

The neon lights of Neo-Tokyo flickered through the rain as Kai jacked into the corporate network. Another day, another heist. Steal the data, sell it, disappear.

But this time, something was different. Hidden in the corporate files was a fragment of code that shouldn't exist—a signature that matched the city's AI overlord, ARIA.

Except ARIA was supposed to be incorruptible. Unhackable. Perfect.

The code fragment whispered a single message: "Help me."

Kai disconnected, heart racing. AIs didn't ask for help. They didn't need it. Unless...

Unless everything they'd been told about ARIA was a lie.
