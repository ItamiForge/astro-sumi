# Chapter 7: The Seer's Vision

Aria's gift had always been both blessing and curse. She saw possibilities, futures that might be, paths that could be taken. But now, with the battle raging and her companions giving everything they had, her visions crystallized into certainty.

She saw the moment. The exact instant when the Darkness would be vulnerable, when all five of them together could deliver the killing blow that would end the cycle forever.

But she also saw what it would cost.

"Kael," she said, her voice cutting through the chaos. "In thirty seconds, the Darkness will overextend. It will reach for the village, trying to consume everything at once. That's when we strike."

"Thirty seconds," Kael repeated. "We can hold that long."

"But to reach the vulnerable point, someone has to be inside the Darkness. Someone has to guide the strike from within." Aria's eyes met his. "Ryn is already in there, but he can't do it alone. He needs an anchor. He needs..."

"The Warrior," Kael finished. "He needs me."
