# Chapter 3: The Darkness Revealed

When the Darkness finally showed itself, it was nothing like Kael had imagined. It wasn't a creature or a demon. It was absence—a void in reality itself, a tear in the fabric of existence that consumed everything it touched.

Light died in its presence. Sound was swallowed. Even thought became difficult, as if the Darkness was erasing not just matter but the very concept of being.

"Hold the line!" Kael shouted, though his voice sounded distant even to his own ears.

The five heroes stood together, their bond blazing like a beacon against the encroaching void. Mira's magic flared brighter, Lyssa's healing light intensified, Ryn's shadows deepened in defiance, and Aria's visions sharpened to crystal clarity.

And Kael... Kael remembered. He remembered every battle against this enemy, every strategy that had worked and every one that had failed. He remembered dying to this Darkness, again and again, across countless lives.

But he also remembered winning. Temporarily, yes, but winning nonetheless.

"It feeds on fear!" he called to his companions. "On despair and hopelessness! Don't give it what it wants!"

Easier said than done. The Darkness whispered to them, showing them visions of failure, of endless cycles, of suffering without end. It showed them the futility of their sacrifice, the meaninglessness of their choice.

But the five heroes had made their decision. And they would see it through.
